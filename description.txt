Adds unobtainable (use a mod like Cheat Sheet or Hero's Mod to get them) items which spawn various Calamity biomes and structures.
A full list of supported structures and biomes:

- All 8 shrines
- Brimstone Crag
- Sunken Sea
- Abyss + Sulphurous Sea (both in one item)
- Luminite Planetoids
- Mechanic's Shed
- Vernal Pass
- All three Forsaken Archive variants
- The Astral Beacon tower
- Every type of Draedon lab
- Disenchanted Aerialite Ore veins

Most structures will generate on your cursor, with the top left of the structure being the anchor with the exceptions being the Brimstone Crag, Abyss+SS, Aerialite veins, and Luminite Planetoids which will automatically generate in their normal locations. The larger ones may also take a while, but will usually eventually generate after at most a few minutes unless they run into a chest (check for chests!).

If you are concerned about your world's state of being, probably turn autosave off or make a backup before using one of the items incase a mistake is made as placement cannot be undone.
